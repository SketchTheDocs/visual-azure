## Why get in touch?

Part of my reason for creating and sharing these visual notes is to help others like me who are making the same learning journeys. My initial goal is to just keep shipping things - not waiting to make them perfect.

But as I keep going, and get into the habit, I definitely want to add or update content that addresses any gaps or corrects any misconceptions that I may have inadvertently promoted. I also want to support and promote other learners and visual storytellers - your perspectives and voices matter.

So if you have questions or comments that help improve this study guide, or if you have resources (including your own sketchnotes) that I can share or amplify, definitely reach out!
 
## How can you get in touch?
 * `TWITTER`: I am [@nitya](https://www.twitter.com/nitya) and my DMs are open. However I do get mixed requests there and I may not always accept a DM request if it does not look to be relevant or respectful of my time.
 * `DEV.TO`: I will be publishing regular posts on dev.to under the [#sketchthedocs](https://dev.to/tag/sketchthedocs) tag. Look for the series on #VisualAzure - and comment directly on relevant posts. This is ideal if you want to engage with other members within that community directly.
 * `GITHUB`: If you have corrections (to a specific post) or requests (for specific content changes or additions), consider [submitting an issue](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/issues). For everything else, consider using the [Discussions](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions/1) board to introduce yourself, share ideas, ask questions and more. _This is my preferred method for interactions._
