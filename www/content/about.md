VisualAzure is a project with three primary objectives:
 * `Consistency` | Build a _visual vocabulary_ (colors, icons, metaphors) for Azure.
 * `Content` | Use the vocabulary to create a _visual study guide_ for [Certification](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx).
 * `Community` | Support community learning and sharing with a _discussion forum_.

The secondary objective -- create awareness of visual storytelling processes and resources, and inspire other learners to create and share their own sketchnotes. By sharing and remixing such resources, we can gain more insights and improve our collective understanding and usage of cloud computing.


#### Have questions, comments or feedback?

Check out the [Discussion](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions) forum first and don't forget to [say hello](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions/1). You can also find me on Twitter ([@nitya](https://www.twitter.com/nitya)) or comment on related posts on Dev.to ([@nitya](https://dev.to/nitya)) where relevant.

I would love to hear about your own learning or visual storytelling journeys, and about ways to make this a better learning resource for everyone. And definitely share your goals and your wins (large and small) - I'm here to cheer on the first, and amplify the second!

## Azure Fundamentals

[Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) are the foundational learning paths for anyone interested in exploring cloud computing in general, and the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) platform in particular. This is a beginner-friendly series that can be completed at your own pace, with an _Azure sandbox_ environment (no account needed) for hands-on experience. This series is also the recommended learning resource for preparing for the [AZ-900](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx) Certification exam.

The long-term [Study Plan](http://localhost:1313/visual-azure/guide/) is to explore other [Azure Certfication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=certification&type=fundamentals&products=azure) options - with [Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals) and [Azure Data Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals) being the likely next steps. 

## Visual Storytelling

Humans learn in many ways - by reading and writing (e.g., text books and blogs), listening (e.g., lectures and podcasts), doing (e.g., hands-on tutorials and projects) and seeing (e.g., charts and visualizations). When it comes to technical documentation and training, visual notes (aka _sketchnotes_) provide a unique resource that combines visual vocabularies with individual perspectives.

This gives three benefits:
 * _Diversity of Perspectives_ | Visual note-takers capture and synthesize learnings, often revealing new insights that benefit from their personal experiences or understanding of the topic.
 * _Inclusivity of Format_ | Images and visual cues (icons, symbols, colors) may translate better across lanugages and cultures, as opposed to pure text. Creating consistent visual vocabularies is key.
 * _Speed of Connection_ | Visual cues help us make connections faster, detecting familiar patterns and extrapolating that knowledge to reinforce understanding. Visual metaphors and analogies are key.
 

Want to build your own visual storytelling skills? Check out this [workshop series](https://dev.to/azure/visualizeit-a-free-online-series-of-workshops-to-build-your-visual-storytelling-skills-d2b) I organized with other members of the community and follow the #SketchTheDocs tags [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/SketchTheDocs?src=hashtag_click) and [on dev.to](https://dev.to/tag/sketchthedocs).


## The Study Plan

Check out the [Guide](https://sketchthedocs.dev/visual-azure/guide/) page for a roadmap listing the learning paths and related certification options of interest. 

My plan is create and share a sketchnote a day - where the sketchnote can map to a module, a unit (within a module), or a specific concept or process that is relevant to our Azure learning journey. The sketchnote post will link to the relevant source, and potentially provide other resource links to help clarify the ideas further.

On occasion, the sketchnote (and learning module or resource) may relate to a different learning path or product. There will usually be an associated context for this. For instance, there may be a relevant [Cloud Skills Challenge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloudskillschallenge/) or [Learn Event](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/tv/) where completion of specific modules or paths may provide additional value to those who are seeking certifications.


## About Me

Hi, I'm Nitya! I'm a Senior Cloud Advocate on the Developer Relations team at Microsoft! My interests span mobile & web development, machine learning and distributed systems. I'm also a long time sketchnoter and community organizer, and see visual storytelling as a key tool for communicating complex concepts in more inclusive ways that are easier to understand, retain and recall, by anyone.
