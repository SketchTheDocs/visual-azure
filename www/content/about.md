Hello, and welcome to #VisualAzure -- a project to build a _Visual Study Guide_ for [Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) and more, with the added purpose of also providing a quick and easy review guide for those seeking relevant _[Certification](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx)_ in one or more categories. 

## Azure Fundamentals

The main purpose of this site is to help everyone, especially beginners, get a more comprehensive understanding of the cloud computing space, using the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com) platform as a reference point for describing relevant terminology, concepts and solutions for developers. 

[Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/) refers to the foundational courses provided by Microsoft Learn, and targeted at beginners. Each learning path has several modules, each composed of smaller units that can be completed in short intervals, allowing you to finish the course at your own pace. You also get to learn by doing, using a _sandbox_ provided within the content, to explore the Azure services and features without cost. The Fundamentals series is a recommended resource for taking the [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx) Certification exam.

While the initial focus of this guide is on Azure Fundamentals (core), the [Study Plan](http://localhost:1313/visual-azure/guide/) is to extend beyond this to other [Azure Certfication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/?resource_type=certification&type=fundamentals&products=azure) options including [Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals) and [Azure Data Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals) and their respective learning paths. Check back regularly for updates.

## Visual Storytelling

Humans learn in many ways - by reading and writing (e.g., text books and blogs), listening (e.g., lectures and podcasts), doing (e.g., hands-on tutorials and projects) and seeing (e.g., charts and visualizations). When it comes to technical documentation and training, there is a lot of content of varying complexity - and not much of it is visual by default.

To me, #VisualAzure is about three things:
 * `Consistency` | Building a _visual vocabulary_ (colors, icons, metaphors) for Azure.
 * `Content` | Using the vocabulary to create _visual notes_ for relevant documentation or training
 * `Community` | Sharing these notes in a _study guide_ to support those preparing for certifications

 A secondary goal is to encourage more folks to explore _creating_ visual notes or enhancing these study guides with their own sketchnotes. What makes these notes unique is the _individual's perspective_. By sharing and remixing these notes, we can all improve our collective understanding and usage of cloud computing.


## The Study Plan

 These are the [Certification options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/?type=fundamentals&levels=beginner&products=azure&WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi) for beginners focused on Azure Fundamentals - and it's where I plan to start my Visual Storytelling journey.

 * [AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)
 * [DP-900: Azure Data Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)
 * [AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)

The goal is to release a sketchnote a day, mapping to a single module, or potentially a unit of a module, based on the complexity of the content. We may also add occasional sketchnotes that focus on deep-dives into a specific concept or skill that is [measured](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RE4wsKZ) in the certification exam. And also support other specialized learning paths (e.g., this one for IoT) where relevant to an ongoing discussion. 

The planned schedule for the study guide will be [available here](http://localhost:1313/visual-azure/guide/) so check back for updates.

## About Me

Hi, I'm Nitya! I'm a Senior Cloud Advocate on the Developer Relations team at Microsoft! My interests span mobile & web development, machine learning and distributed systems. I'm also a long time sketchnoter and community organizer, and see visual storytelling as a key tool for communicating complex concepts in more inclusive ways that are easier to understand, retain and recall, by anyone.
