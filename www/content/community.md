Having a study group can help you progress in your learning goals in two ways. First, by giving you a sense of accountability that ensures you keep making progress. Second, by creating a sense of belonging (in a shared journey toward certifications) that can lead to new insights and friendships.

I'm exploring GitHub [Discussion Forums](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions) to bring that sense of community to this project. Want to join the conversations? Please do start by [introducing yourself](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions/1) and share your learning objectives.

## About Discussions

Discussions are a [recent feature on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository) that I am just beginning to explore - so expect some refactoring! I'd like to use the forum for three kinds of discussion:

 * `GENERAL` | Share general feedback on the site and mission, suggest topics I should explore, or share your own learning journeys and achievements around cloud computing or Azure.
 * `GUIDE` | Share specific feedback on an article, a resource or a sketchnote. Identify gaps or errors, or share resources (including your own sketchnotes) that might further clarify a topic.
 * `GROUP` | Connect with others and engage in discussions in respectful and relevant ways. Ask questions (and provide responses if you know them). Let's encourage and amplify each other to succeed!



## Code Of Conduct

It's simple. What unites us all is a shared desire to learn and grow our skills in this ecosystem. We are all living through interesting and challenging times, so let's adopt three behaviors.

 * `Be inclusive` | This is a judgement-free zone. There is no room for bias, harassment or disrespect in our conversations. Everyone is welcome.
 * `Be fearless` | Failure means progress. If you have questions or comments, share them and ask for help. You'll be surprised at how many folks are facing the same challenge.
 * `Be kind` | We all walked different paths to get here, and have different stories to tell. Be empathetic and don't just look for the helpers -- be one!
 
I am still figuring out all the features of the Discussion forums on GitHub - but if you have any concerns, do reach out to me. [My DMs are open on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nitya).
