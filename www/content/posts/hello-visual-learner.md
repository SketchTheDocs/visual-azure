## Setting the Stage!

Yes, it’s 2021. We’re already a month into the New Year! And if you are like me and many others, you’ve probably made a resolution to learn something new, or skill up on something you already have experience with.

**My 2021 resolution:** 

Learn all things Azure by completing all Fundamentals learning paths and validating my knowledge with relevant certfications! Specifically, these three -- in this order.

 * [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals) | Azure Fundamentals - for core cloud computing concepts
 * [DP-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals) | Azure Data Fundamentals - for relational and non-relational data workloads
 * [AI-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals) | Azure AI Fundamentals - for machine learning and AI workloads
 
**Why do this?**

Thanks to increased remote work opportunities, there's never been a better time to skill up. Gain:

 * `Knowledge` | Cloud computing skills are in high demand. Knowing terminology and ecosystem helps!
 * `Experience` | Learn paths have Azure sandbox environments. Getting hands-on experience helps!
 * `Certification` | Validate your knowledge with exams. Getting a professional credential helps!

**What is Visual Azure?**

Learn more about the project [here](https://sketchthedocs.dev/visual-azure/about/). I'm doing three things on this site, to keep me focused on those goals.

 * `Visual Study Notes` | Create a sketchnote per core module or unit - to support exam prep.
 * `Regular Study Habits` | Share sketchnote & learnings in a daily post - to stay accountable.
 * `Community Discussion Forums`| Create and participate in open discussions - to share learning.

Having a habit tracker - something that creates a "streak" from study activity -- can help motivate you to keep going ("don't break that streak!"). My habit tracker task is to sketch-and-share on a daily basis. Think of doing something similar to keep you accountable.
