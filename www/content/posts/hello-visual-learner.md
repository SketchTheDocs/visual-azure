Yes, it’s 2021. We’re already a month into the New Year! And if you are like me and many others, you’ve probably made a resolution to learn something new, or skill up on something you already have experience with.

**My 2021 resolution:** 

Learn all things Azure by completing all Fundamentals learning paths and validating my knowledge with relevant certfications! Specifically, these three -- in this order.

 * [AZ-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals) | Azure Fundamentals - for core cloud computing concepts
 * [DP-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals) | Azure Data Fundamentals - for relational and non-relational data workloads
 * [AI-900](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals) | Azure AI Fundamentals - for machine learning and AI workloads
 
**Why do this?**

Thanks to increased remote work opportunities, there's never been a better time to skill up. Gain:

 * `Knowledge` | Cloud computing skills are in high demand. Knowing terminology and ecosystem helps!
 * `Experience` | Learn paths have Azure sandbox environments. Getting hands-on experience helps!
 * `Certification` | Validate your knowledge with exams. Getting a professional credential helps!

**What is Visual Azure?**

Think of it as a visual study guide, where I capture sketchnotes on things I learn, which can then help me review materials (and recall them more easily) when it's time for exam prep. And, hopefully share this with community as a study resource for their own learning journeys.
Learn more about the project [here](/visual-azure/about/). 

It basically comes down to three things I want to do, to support my learning goals:

 * `Visual Study Notes` | Create sketchnotes mapping to [required skills](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/blob/main/RESOURCES.md) - support exam prep.
 * `Regular Study Habits` | Share sketchnote & learnings in [daily posts](http://localhost:1313/visual-azure/posts/) - stay accountable.
 * `Community Discussion Forums`| Create and participate in [open discussions](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions) - share learning.

Anything involving self-study requires good habits to stay focused and motivated. Habit trackers that create "streaks" from an activity are known to be effective (because we don't want to break a streak). 

So a motivation for me is to use this blog to stay accountable by learning, sketching and sharing _something_ every day. Not everything will be perfect, and I may do more on some days than others - but the goal is to _keep shipping_ and come back to clean up later.

## Want to Join Me?


Consider doing something similar to keep yourself accountable to your learning goals. Why not join me? Here are three things you can do to commit to a 2021 From-Learning-to-Certification goal!

  * [Bookmark the Guide](https://sketchthedocs.dev/visual-azure/guide/) - explore the learning paths at your own pace!
  * [Join the Community](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions) - say hello, share your learning goals, post feedback!
  * [Set a Daily Routine](https://sketchthedocs.dev/visual-azure/posts/) - look for my posts for ideas, share your own or set a different habit.

Sharing your progress (and celebrating wins big and small) helps! Feel free to start a [Discussion](https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions), or share your own posts (sketchnotes or articles) on social media - and tag me (@nitya) or use #VisualAzure. I'd love to follow your learning journeys and amplify your insights! 

Happy Trails!
