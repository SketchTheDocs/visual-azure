# A Visual Study Guide to Azure Fundamentals


_Azure_ is Microsoft's primary Cloud+AI Computing Platform. It currently has over 20 categories of products, and over 200 cloud services defined within them. 

As a Cloud Advocate on the Microsoft Developer Relations team, I resolved to learn everything I could about this vast ecosystem, and to create content and code resources that can help the developer community navigate and understand it better.


In 2021, I started this project with three goals:

 * Complete all MSLearn Azure _Fundamentals_ learning paths.
 * Summarize key concepts and learnings with _Sketchnotes._
 * Synthesize them into a _Visual Guide_ for Azure Certifications.

## About Azure Fundamentals

The Microsoft Learn site has numerous learning resources (individual _modules_ and structured _learning paths_) for various Microsoft technologies. 

Many provide paths to Certifications. These are the [Certification options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/browse/?type=fundamentals&levels=beginner&products=azure&WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi) for beginners focused on Azure Fundamentals.

 * [AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)
 * [DP-900: Azure Data Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-data-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)
 * [AI-900: Azure AI Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/azure-ai-fundamentals?WT.mc_id=mobile-0000-ninarasi)

 And these are the relevant learning paths associated (or recommended) for those Certifications

## About Sketchnotes

What are sketchnotes? 

I see them as _illustrative notes_ combining text (typography), imagery (sketches, iconography) and color with composition to create _visual representations_ of the source content (talk or document). They can serve two purposes:

 * `INFORMATION SUMMARIZATION`. Focus on distilling information quickly and succinctly, often as visual notes for related talks or articles.

 * `INFORMATION SYNTHESIS`. Focus on adding visual context and connections to make that information easier to understand or recall. 
 
The first captures the perspective of the content ("exactly as is, but more succinctly") while the second layers on the perspective of the sketchnoter ("filling in the gaps, making connections"), using their personal insights or expertise on the topic to make the material easier to understand or navigate.


## About This Visual Guide

The goal of this project is to create a study guide for Azure Fundamentals certification that uses sketchnotes to complement existing resources. 

There are three components to this:

 * `CONSISTENCY`: Build a visual vocabulary for Azure that becomes familiar over time, allowing for more effective summarization and synthesis.
 * `CONTINUITY`: Create and share at least one sketchnote each day, motivating readers to keep progressing on their learning journeys.
 * `CERTIFICATION`: Provide a resource that learners can scan quickly (for review or recall), when prepping for their certification exams.

This repository will host the sketchnote images, and power a related website (TBD) for quick navigation. The website will feature one new sketchnote a day - related to a single module, or a unit within a module - with links to the relevant learning path. Simply review the content each day, and before you know it, you would have finished the entire learning path!


## Website Planning

TBD.

Current thinking: Use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with some simple [Portfolio theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/portfolio/) - and deploy the generated static website to the GitHub Pages endpoint on this repo. Stay tuned!
