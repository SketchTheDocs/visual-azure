      <description>Having a study group can help you progress in your learning goals in two ways. First, by giving you a sense of accountability that ensures you keep making progress. Second, by creating a sense of belonging (in a shared journey toward certifications) that can lead to new insights and friendships.
I&amp;rsquo;m exploring GitHub Discussion Forums to bring that sense of community to this project. Want to join the conversations? Please do start by introducing yourself and share your learning objectives.</description>

      <title>Visual Guide</title>

      <description>Using The Guide Use the guide in three ways:
 Pre-view Content | Use the sketchnote as a glanceable resource to get context for the terminology and topics related to the linked module or unit &amp;ndash; then visit the link to complete the content for yourself. You might find it helps you uncover new insights, or reinforce connections you&amp;rsquo;d made. Pre-exam Review | Use the sketchnote for quick review of materials when prepping for certification.</description>

      <description>Setting the Stage! Yes, it’s 2021. We’re already a month into the New Year! And if you are like me and many others, you’ve probably made a resolution to learn something new, or skill up on something you already have experience with.
My 2021 resolution:
Learn all things Azure by completing all Fundamentals learning paths and validating my knowledge with relevant certfications! Specifically, these three &amp;ndash; in this order.
 AZ-900 | Azure Fundamentals - for core cloud computing concepts DP-900 | Azure Data Fundamentals - for relational and non-relational data workloads AI-900 | Azure AI Fundamentals - for machine learning and AI workloads  Why do this?</description>

      <description>VisualAzure is a project with three primary objectives:
 Consistency | Build a visual vocabulary (colors, icons, metaphors) for Azure. Content | Use the vocabulary to create a visual study guide for Certification. Community | Support community learning and sharing with a discussion forum.  The secondary objective &amp;ndash; create awareness of visual storytelling processes and resources, and inspire other learners to create and share their own sketchnotes. By sharing and remixing such resources, we can gain more insights and improve our collective understanding and usage of cloud computing.</description>
