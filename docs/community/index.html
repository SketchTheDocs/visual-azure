    <p>Having a study group or learning community can help you progress in your learning goals in two ways. First, by giving you a sense of accountability that ensures you keep making progress. Second, by creating a sense of belonging (in a shared journey toward certifications) that can lead to new insights and friendships.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m exploring GitHub <a href="https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions">Discussion Forums</a> to support community interactions around this project. Want to join the conversations? Please do start by <a href="https://github.com/SketchTheDocs/visual-azure/discussions/1">introducing yourself</a> and share your learning objectives.</p>
<h2 id="about-discussions">About Discussions</h2>
<p>Discussions are a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/discussions/managing-discussions-for-your-community/managing-discussions-in-your-repository">recent feature on GitHub</a> that I just started to explore. New discussions are created with a specific category in mind. Here are the current categories in this forum:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals</code> - post resources, learnings or questions about any modules or posts related to the AZ-900 certification track.</li>
<li><code>Ideas &amp; Requests</code> - post suggestions for improving the guide (or site/forum), and requests for sketchnotes of specific modules or units (with a relevant resource link).</li>
<li><code>Show &amp; Tell</code> - share resources or projects you&rsquo;ve created, to support your learning goals. This could include your own sketchnotes!</li>
<li><code>Q&amp;A</code> - The default Q&amp;A section for anything not related to AZ-900.</li>
<li><code>General</code> - the default category for any other discussion</li>
</ul>
<p>Most categories are <em>open-ended</em>, allowing free-flowing conversation on those topics.</p>
<p>However, the <code>Ideas</code> and <code>Q&amp;A</code> categories fall into a special <em>question/answer</em> class, where members post a request to get responses and the community can also vote up the best response. <em>Keep this in mind and check for existing questions or requests to vote on, instead of submitting a duplicate.</em></p>
<h2 id="code-of-conduct">Code Of Conduct</h2>
<p>What unites us all is a shared desire to learn and grow our skills in this ecosystem. We are all living through interesting and challenging times, so let&rsquo;s be good community citizens. Here are three behaviors that can help you get the best from this forum:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Be inclusive</code> | This is a judgement-free zone. There is no room for bias, harassment or disrespect in our communities. Everyone belongs, and is welcome. We all have something to learn.</li>
<li><code>Be fearless</code> | Failure means progress. If you have questions or comments, share them and ask for help. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how many others will likely share your issue, and may even have solutions.</li>
<li><code>Be kind</code> | We all walked different paths to get here, and have different stories to tell. Be empathetic and don&rsquo;t make assumptions. Help where you can, and pay it forward.</li>
</ul>
